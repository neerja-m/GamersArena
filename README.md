 ## Business Context

Gamers' Arena is a website that provides information about video games. It keeps track of the games that have been released and their sales across various platforms and genres. Different genres, such as RPGs, shooters, multiplayer, action, and so on, would appeal to different audiences. Gamers' Arena has also implemented a feature on their website that allows gamers to subscribe to their platform on a month-to-month basis. They can play a limited number of games as long as they have a subscription.

## Problem Statement
Design an interactive dashboard that helps the company make a decision on a new sales model (a subscription model) that will attract more gamers to the platform.
